# UI

User interface is very important for the playability of a game. Menus should be easy to navigate and shouldn't gat in the way of gameplay. I chose to use bevy's in built UI elements such as the text component for my menus. The text component is based off of css and gives me many options such as text colour and contents along with the positioning of text.
