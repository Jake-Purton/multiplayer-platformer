# Physics

I decided to use [bevy_rapier](https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/bevy_plugin/getting_started_bevy) instead of writing my own physics engine. Writing my own physics engine would take a long time and would not be as fast or simple as the rapier engine. Games should be able to run efficiently so that frames are not lost and the playing experience is good.
