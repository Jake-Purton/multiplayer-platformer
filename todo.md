To do:

make levels server side.
1. load the text document
2. serialise it
3. send it over
4. other player loads it
the player has to go into a loading state while the map is waited for / constructed

make new maps for multiplayer (pretty much just a new directory for multiplayer levels)

make map more efficient by turning groups of blocks into one large block

let you go back to the previous part of the menu

make a lovely background with a shader texture

make a level editor?

make the grapple physics nicer and possibly add a rope.
